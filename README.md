# YAML Resume

## Problems

1. Writing a resume with a WYSIWYG editor results in formatting/styling being mixed with data.

2. I don't know anything about LaTeX styles, but HTML and CSS are okay.

## Solution

- Data -> YAML
- Formatting -> HTML
- Styling -> CSS

## Actual Result

I actually needed something that would work for my spouse, so this was hacked together pretty quickly. It wouldn't be too much more work to make it more useful, but using LaTex would have probably been a better route.
